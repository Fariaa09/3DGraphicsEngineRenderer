# 3D Graphics Engine
This is a small 3D engine project using the least number of dependencies.
This idea comes from a come youttube videos that describe the process of
making a 3D graphics Engine from scratch in C.

---
## How its made
**Built with:**
* SDL2

---
## Optimizations

---
## What I Learned
Through this project I learned how to make and use macros in C to make
the code cleaner and easier to understand. I also built knowledge arround
the SDL2 library, as well as 3D graphics computing.

---
## Getting started
### Prerequisites
Having WSL installed (I used ubuntu). If you do not have WSL you can install
it through the Microsoft app store.

To install Ubuntu run:
`wsl --install -d Ubuntu` in the WSL command line.

You will need SDL2 installed in WSL also. You can use:
`sudo apt install libsdl2-dev` to install it.
